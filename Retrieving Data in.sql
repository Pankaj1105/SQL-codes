-- Get all columns from employees table
SELECT * FROM employees;

-- Get specific columns from employees table
SELECT EmployeeId, FirstName, LastName FROM employees;

-- Sequence of SQL clauses:
-- SELECT > FROM > WHERE > GROUP BY > HAVING > ORDER BY > LIMIT

-- Get employees in HR department
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE Department = 'HR';

-- Get employees whose department starts with 'M'
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE Department LIKE 'M%';

-- Sort by salary ascending (default)
SELECT * FROM employees
ORDER BY Salary;

-- Sort by salary descending
SELECT * FROM employees
ORDER BY Salary DESC;

-- Rename FirstName column as Name
SELECT FirstName AS Name 
FROM employees;

-- Combine first and last names into a full name
SELECT CONCAT(FirstName, ' ', LastName) AS FullName
FROM employees;

-- Get unique department names
SELECT DISTINCT Department
FROM employees;


/* ========================================
   3. Limit and Select with Expressions
   ======================================== */
